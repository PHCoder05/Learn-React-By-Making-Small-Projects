#  build-a-react-info-site


Welcome to my **React Info Site** project! 🎉 This project provides a minimal setup to get React working seamlessly with Vite. It includes Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and some basic ESLint rules to ensure code quality.

## 🚀 Getting Started

This template is designed to help you kickstart your React projects quickly. It uses Vite, a fast build tool, to provide a smooth development experience.

### Key Features

- **React + Vite**: Combines React with Vite for a modern development setup.
- **HMR (Hot Module Replacement)**: Enjoy a fast and efficient development experience with immediate feedback on changes.
- **ESLint Rules**: Includes some ESLint rules to maintain code quality and consistency.

### Official Plugins

This setup includes two official plugins:

- **[@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md)**: Utilizes [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh, enhancing development speed with automatic component updates.
- **[@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc)**: Employs [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh, providing an alternative to Babel for improved performance.
